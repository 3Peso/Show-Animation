# Show-Animation

Things you do, when you have to much time left during your day ;-)

## Usage

Simply import `Animate.psm1` with `Import-Module .\Animate.psm1`. Afterwards run `Show-Animation` to show a Tic-Tac-Toe animated bar at the top of the PowerShell window.
Alternatively you can run a walking man animation with `Show-Animation -animationTemplate $(Get-WalkingManAnimation)`.

## Idea

Originally I thought, this could proof to be useful during more time consuming operations. But never used it productively. Still, by changing the animation, maybe you can
put it to some use.
